create new project
add buttons play and quit 
add events, on pressed 
script to change the scene

the world is a scene and the player is another one imported into it
the player is just a 2d player node?? no its name is 
	Character Body 2D

it has animation node? yes animation is a node "animated sprite 2D" :)

and the animation has sprite frames=> which are taken from the sprite sheet (the png image with all the frames/images you need to make a sequence that looks like an acceptable animation :) )

and another node for the collision shape, 
but how do they connect? just by making the collision shape a child node under the character body node? :) I think so, that is the only connection
the other connection is the position of the collision body with respect to the character body
the position on the scence they are "definded" in


the script (the template one for moving 2d characters) 
the player script, extend the character body 2d first
then write the required functions
it has a main function that is called each moment 
the physics ? yes __physics_process(delta)
it is responsible for calculating the movements and stuff
each delta time :) which is really small
at the end of it we propably will use 
the move and slide method :)
becaused this is the metehod that "draws" the new frame , right?
